# Array Methods in JavaScript

First, let's understand what an array is before exploring more about array methods.

## What is Array?

An Array object in JavaScript is used to store a collection of multiple items under a single variable name. We can fetch any array element with the help of array indices.

Example of an array in JavaScript:

```javascript
let arr = [1, "Apple", "Banana", true];
```

## Array Methods

*   `length` : This method is used to get the length of an array i.e. how many elements are present in an array.

*   `push()` : This method is used to insert one or more elements in an array. The elements are added at the end of an array.

*   `pop()` : This method is used to remove an element from an element. The element is removed from the last.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/03popArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `slice()` : This method is used to get a portion of the array according to the value of the index provided in the method. The ending index given in the method is not included.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/04sliceArrayMethod#index.jshttps://replit.com/@atrovoid/04sliceArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `splice()` : This method is used to remove or replace an existing element of the array and/or add a new element in its place.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/05spliceArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `concat()` : This method is used to merge or add two or more arrays. It returns a new array after merging.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/06concatArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `fill()` : This method is used to change all the elements in the array to a static value, from a start index to an end index and returns the modified array.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/07fillArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `includes()` : This method is used to determine whether a certain value is present in an array or not.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/08includesArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `indexOf()` : This method is used to get the first index at which a particular element is present in an array.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/09indexOfArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `isArray()` : This method is used to check whether the provided value is an array or not.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/10isArrayArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `join()` : This method is used to concatenate all elements of an array. It creates and returns a new string.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/11joinArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `keys()` : This method is used to create an iterator object that contains only the keys of the array.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/12createArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `lastIndexOf()` : This method is used to get the last index at which the given element can be found.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/13lastIndexOfArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `map()` : This method is used to call the specified function for every array element and return the new array.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/14mapArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `reverse()` : This method is used to reverse the elements of the given array.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/15reverseArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `shift()` : This method is used to remove the first element of an array and returns the removed element.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/16shiftArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `unshift()` : This method is used to add one or more elements at the beginning of the array and it returns the new array length.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/17unshiftArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `sort()` : This method is used to sort the elements of an array. The default sort order is ascending.
    
    %[https://replit.com/@atrovoid/18sortArrayMethod#index.js] 
    
*   `split()` : This method is used to convert a string to an array.
